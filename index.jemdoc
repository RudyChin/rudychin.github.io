== About me
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student co-advised by [https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~dianam/ Prof. Diana Marculescu] and [https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/ Prof. Gauri Joshi]. My research interests include /Model Compression/, /Neural Architecture Search/ and /Trasnsfer Learning/ for /Deep ConvNets/.\n\n 

Before joining CMU, I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from National Chiao Tung University ([https://www.nctu.edu.tw/en NCTU]), in 2015 and 2017, respectively.
